/// Fetch (Uncommon, 0 energy, Attack, AnyEnemy). The Osty attacks the target
/// for 3 (6 upgraded); then — only if Fetch has not already been played and
/// resolved this turn — the player draws 1 card. Does nothing (neither the
/// damage nor the draw) when the Osty is missing.
//
// C# OnPlay:
//   ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(cardPlay.Target);
//   if (!Osty.CheckMissingWithAnim(Owner)) {
//       DamageCmd.Attack(OstyDamage.BaseValue)   // 3, +3 on upgrade → 6
//           .FromOsty(Owner.Osty, this)          // attacker is the OSTY, not the player
//           .Targeting(cardPlay.Target)
//           .WithHitFx(...)                       // cosmetic, ignored
//           .Execute(...);
//       if (!HasBeenPlayedThisTurn)
//           await CardPileCmd.Draw(ctx, Cards.BaseValue /* 1 */, Owner);
//   }
//
// CanonicalVars:
//   OstyDamageVar(3m, Move)  → base_damage 3 (cosmetic metadata; the hit is dealt
//                              by the Osty, not the player). OnUpgrade +3 → 6.
//   CardsVar(1)              → draw 1 (CardPileCmd.Draw → draw_via_state). Not
//                              touched by OnUpgrade.
// CanonicalTags: OstyAttack (cosmetic glow tag; not carried in CardSpec here).
// ShouldGlowRedInternal => Owner.IsOstyMissing — pure UI, ignored.
// ShouldGlowGoldInternal => !HasBeenPlayedThisTurn — pure UI, ignored.
//
// Both the damage AND the draw sit inside the `if (!CheckMissingWithAnim)` block,
// so when the Osty is missing the entire effect is a no-op. `deal_damage_from_
// osty_to_enemy` is itself a no-op when the Osty is absent (`osty_dealer_ref` →
// None); we gate the draw on the same Osty-alive check to reproduce that.
//
// BLOCKER (recorded, not faked): the C# draw is additionally gated on
// `!HasBeenPlayedThisTurn`, where `HasBeenPlayedThisTurn` scans
// `CombatManager.History.CardPlaysFinished` for a *finished* play of THIS card
// instance during the current turn. The engine has no per-card-instance
// finished-play history (no `times_played_this_turn`/play-history surface — see
// the VarKey table in sts2-core/src/cards.rs, which has no such slot). On the
// first play of the turn the current OnPlay has not finished, so the history is
// empty and the card draws; this handler therefore draws unconditionally, which
// is FAITHFUL for the single-play-per-turn case (the overwhelmingly common one).
// It diverges only when Fetch is returned to hand and replayed within the same
// turn — C# would then skip the draw, but this handler still draws. Implementing
// the guard requires a per-instance turn-scoped played-flag (e.g. a `VarKey::
// FetchPlayedThisTurn` set after resolve and cleared at turn cleanup, mirroring
// the `FreeThisTurn`/`Bolas` per-card turn-flag pattern).
